It has been said that the human mind has never invented a BAMBAM 
labor-saving machine equal to algebra.
If this be true, it is but natural and proper that an age like our own, characterized by the
multiplication of labor-saving machinery, should be distinguished by
an unexampled development of this most refined and most beautiful
of machines. That such has been the case, none will question.
The improvement has been in every part. Even to enumerate the
principal lines of advance would be a task for any one; for me an
impossibility. But if we should ask, in what direction the advance
has been made, which is to characterize the development of algebra
in our day, we may, I think, point to that broadening of its field and
methods, which gives us multiple algebra. Of the importance of this change in the conception of the office
of algebra, it is hardly necessary to speak: that it is really characteristic
of our time will be most evident if we go back some e two- or
threescore years, to the time when the seeds were sown which are
now yielding so abundant a harvest. The failure of M¨obius, Hamilton,
Grassmann, Saint-Venant to make an immediate impression upon the course of mathematical thought in any way commensurate
with the importance of their discoveries is the most conspicuous
evidence that the times were not ripe for the methods which
they sought to introduce. A satisfactory theory of the imaginary
quantities of ordinary algebra, which is essentially a simple case
of multiple algebra, with difficulty obtained recognition in the first
third of this century. We must observe that this double algebra, as
it has been called, was not sought for or invented;—it forced itself,
unbidden, upon the attention of mathematicians, and with its rules
already formed. But the idea of double algebra, once received, although as it
were unwillingly, must have suggested to many minds, more or less
distinctly, the possibility of other multiple algebras, of higher orders,
possessing interesting or useful properties.
